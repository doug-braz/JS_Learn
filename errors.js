// For further understanding of a language, it is important to understand all the common types of errors we may encounter during development

// 1) Reference Error
// console.log(variable)

// Running this first line of code we will encounter a Reference Error. This error is associated with the usage of a variable that has not been previously declared.

// 2) Syntax Error
//console.log("Hello world"

// Running this line of code will lead us to a Syntax Error. A syntax error is an error associated with an incorrect structure of a given code. In this example, it is lacking the closing parentheses to a correct usage of console.log()

// 3) Type error
// const name = 'Leon'
// name = 'Jill'

// A Type Error is associated with operating variable in a way that its type does not support. In this example, it returns a type error because there is an attempt to reassign the value of a variable that is declared as a 'const'
